# Game Engine Frameworks & Patterns Project #2: Key Scripting Component Using LUA

This solution was created using Visual Studio Community 2022 Version 17 Toolset v143.

The project is currently configured to be build and run in Debug and Release mode, both on x64 architecture.

Debug messages are only displayed in console when running in Debug Mode.

The Application will automatically display some of the Key Scripting functionalities using LUA when running.

Afther the initial automated scripts, these are the user inputs expected during gameplay:
